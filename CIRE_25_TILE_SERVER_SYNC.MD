# Notes on this PR

Need to punt desired functionality for now which is

- Self host tile server and routing service ( OSRM )

Resource constraints of my server simply do not allow it ( silly overlook by me )

I have a server at home I could serve this from using Cloudflare Tunnels. Even this might not be enough though.
